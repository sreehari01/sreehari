                <p>
                    Primary treatment involves temporary holding of the wastewater in a tank the heavy solids get settled at the bottom while oil,grease and lighter solids float over the surface .The settle and floating materials are removed.The remaining undergoes secondary treatmant.

                <h2>Secondary</h2>
                <p>
                    Secondary treatment is used to remove the biodegradable dissloved organic matter.This is performed in the presence of oxygen by aerobic microorganism.The microorganisms must be separated from treated water waste by sedimentation.after that,the remaining liquid is discharged for tertiary treatment.

                <h2>Tertiary</h2>
                <p>
                Tertiary or advanced treatment is the final step of sewage treatment.it involves removal of inorganic constituents such as nitrogen,phosphorus and microoranisms.The fine collidal particles in the sewage water are precipitated by adding chemical coagulants like alum or ferric sulphate.
